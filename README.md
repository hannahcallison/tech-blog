# MVC Tech Blog

## Introduction 
For this project we created a technology blog. By using the packages listed below we creates a CMS-style blog where users can publish, edit, and delete their posts as well as comment on blog posts made by other creators. 

## Disclaimer
We worked on a mini project in class that heavily influenced the work in this homework. If you have any plagirism concerns please reach out to me and I can direct you to my instructor who can vouch for this claim. 

## Installation
Users can use the deployed Heroku link below or can run the program on their local host. TO run on the local host users will need to download the packages by running the command 'npm i'. Users will also need to create a .env file in order to connect the program to Sequelize by using the .env_sample file as an outline. They need to run mysql and download the .sql docs by typing 'mysql -u root -p' and entering their sequel password. Once that is entered they can run the command 'SOURCE db/schema.sql'. After quitting mysql users must run the command 'npm run seed' and then 'npm start' to activate listening on the local host.
